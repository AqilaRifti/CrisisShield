# CrisisShield - Hackathon Pitch
## 3-Minute Presentation Script

---

## Opening Hook (15 seconds)
*"Imagine losing everything you've built overnight. Your business, your livelihood, your family's future—gone in a flood, a pandemic, or an economic crash. For millions of small businesses in developing regions, this isn't imagination. It's reality."*

---

## The Problem (30 seconds)

**The harsh truth:**
- **90% of small businesses** in developing countries have NO disaster preparedness plan
- When crisis strikes, **60% never reopen** their doors
- In regions like Southeast Asia, businesses face floods, typhoons, pandemics, and economic instability—often multiple crises per year
- Traditional emergency planning is expensive, complex, and designed for large corporations
- Small business owners are left vulnerable, unprepared, and alone

**Real impact:** A single flood can destroy a family restaurant that took 20 years to build. A pandemic can bankrupt a retail store in weeks. These aren't just statistics—they're families losing their dreams.

## Q&A Preparation

**Expected Questions:**

**Q: How accurate is your threat prediction?**
A: We aggregate data from multiple sources (weather APIs, economic indicators, historical patterns) and use AI to analyze patterns. Our system provides probability-based predictions with confidence scores. We're transparent about uncertainty and focus on actionable preparation rather than perfect prediction.

**Q: What about businesses without internet?**
A: We're building SMS alert capabilities and offline-first mobile apps. Critical alerts can be delivered via text message, and plans can be downloaded for offline access.

**Q: How do you handle different languages?**
A: Our architecture supports i18n (internationalization). We're starting with English and Indonesian, with plans to add Tagalog, Vietnamese, and Hindi based on market demand.

**Q: What's your competitive advantage?**
A: Three things: (1) AI-powered personalization at scale, (2) Focus on underserved SMEs in developing regions, (3) End-to-end solution from prediction to recovery, not just one piece.

**Q: How do you verify funding opportunities?**
A: We partner with verified relief organizations and government agencies. Our database is curated and updated regularly. We also use AI to match businesses with the most relevant opportunities.

**Q: What about data privacy?**
A: We're GDPR-compliant and use enterprise-grade encryption. Business data is never sold. Users control their data and can export or delete it anytime.

**Q: How quickly can this scale?**
A: Our cloud infrastructure (Supabase + Vercel) can handle millions of users. The main scaling challenge is localization and partnership development, which we're addressing through a phased regional rollout.
